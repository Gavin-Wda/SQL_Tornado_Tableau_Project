# SQL Tornado Analysis & Tableau Dashboard

Overview 


The goal of this project was to explore and visualize tornado data within the United States to gain an understanding of their destructive nature. The data used was provided by the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD), covering 68,701 entries from 1950 to 2022. Each entry is an individual tornado with attributes such as magnitude, injuries, property loss, and distance covered (etc.). The first half of this project involved loading the data into SQL for cleaning, optimization, and analysis. The second took a subset of the data in the CST time zone from 2000 to 2022 for further exploration and visualization within Tableau for the creation of a dashboard.
